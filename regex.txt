# Regular expression - REGEX
# Regular expressions are used for matching string patterns 

# Use cases:
1) grep <regex> <filename>
2) javascriptString.match(regex) or javascriptString.test(regex)
Note: Some editors such as 'Sublime Text' use regex for finding text patterns in a filename

# Metacharacters used in regex
^ [ . $
{ * ( \
+ ) | ?
< >

# Anchors
^            Start of string, or start of line in multiline pattern
\A           Start of string
$            End of string, or end of line in multi-line pattern
\Z           End of string
\b           Word boundary
\B           Not word boundary
\<           Start of word
\>           End of word

# Quantifiers
*                  0 or more 
+                  1 or more 
?                  0 or 1 
{3}                Exactly 3
{3,}               3 or more
{3,5}              3, 4 or 5
Note: Add a ? to a quantifier to make it ungreedy.

# Escape Sequences
\                Escape following character
\Q               Begin literal sequence
\E               End literal sequence
Note: 'Escaping' is a way of treating characterswhich have a special meaning in regular expressions literally, rather than as special characters.


# Special Characters
\n               New line
\r               Carriage return
\t               Tab
\v               Vertical tab
\f               Form feed

# Groups and Ranges
.                Any character except new line (\n)
(a|b)            a or b
(...)            Group
(?:...)          Passive (non-capturing) group
[abc]            Range (a or b or c)
[^abc]           Not (a or b or c)
[a-q]            Lower case letter from a to q
[A-Q]            Upper case letter from A to Q
[0-7]            Digit from 0 to 7
\x               Group/subpattern number "x"


# Pattern Modifiers
g          Global match
i         Case-insensitive
m         Multiple lines
s         Treat string as single line
